## CFD -- Chicago face database
https://chicagofaces.org/default/ 

There are two main databases:

1. **CFD**  
      The main CFD set consists of images of 597 unique individuals. They include self-identified Asian, Black, Latino, and White female and male models, recruited in the United States. All models are represented with neutral facial expressions. A subset of the models is also available with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressions. Norming data are available for all neutral expression images. Subjective rating norms are based on a U.S. rater sample.

2. **CFD-MR**  
      The CFD-MR extension set includes images of 88 unique individuals, who self-reported multiracial ancestry. All models were recruited in the United States. The images depict models with neutral facial expressions. Additional facial expression images with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressions are in production and will become available with a future update of the database. Norming data include the standard set of CFD objective and subjective image norms as well as the models’ self-reported ancestry. Subjective norms are based on a U.S. rater sample.

3. ***CFD-INDIA (Forthcoming)***  
      The CFD-India extension set includes images of 142 unique individuals, recruited in Delhi, India. The images depict models with neutral facial expressions. Additional facial expression images with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressionsare in production and will become available with a future update of the database. Norming data include the standard set of CFD objective and subjective image norms and self-reported background information on the models (e.g., ancestry, home state, caste). Subjective norms are available for a U.S. rater sample and for a sample of raters recruited in India.

## Wilma Bainbridge
http://www.wilmabainbridge.com/facememorability2.html 

This database contains 10 168 natural face photographs and several measures for 2 222 of the faces, including memorability scores, computer vision and psychology attributes, and landmark point annotations. The face photographs are JPEGs with 72 pixels/in resolution and 256-pixel height. The attribute data are stored in either MATLAB or Excel files. Landmark annotations are stored in TXT files.

Downloaded are all the files, there is a lot of readme and mat/xlsx/html files, check it.

### Conditions

This one has a few of them, needs to be contacted (and takes quite long but Michal can help). Based on our emails:

Keep in mind that you CANNOT publish faces from the individuals in the 10k-image dataset, only faces from the 49-image dataset. Also keep in mind that the database cannot be used for profit.

**we would appreciate it if you update us on who has access to the database if it changes, just so we can keep our access records up to date. A quick email with the names of people who have access will work!**


## Basel database 
https://bfd.unibas.ch/en/ 

The Basel Face Database (BFD) is built upon portrait photographs of forty different individuals. All these photographs have been manipulated to appear more or less agentic and communal (Big Two personality dimensions) as well as open to experience, conscientious, extraverted, agreeable, and neurotic (Big Five personality dimensions). Thus, the database consists of forty photographs of different individuals and 14 variations of each of them signaling different personalities. Using this database therefore allows to investigate the impact of personality on different outcome variables in a very systematic way.

The BFD consists of photographs of 18 male and 22 female undergraduate students from the University of Basel with an average age of 23 years. The individuals look directly towards the camera with a neutral, relaxed facial expression.

All 40 photographs have been systematically manipulated to show reduced or enhanced values on the Big Two (agency and communion) and on the Big Five (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and extraversion) personality dimensions. This results in a total of 15 images per individual, and 600 images in total.

The validation file contains means and standard deviations of the Big Two and Big Five personality judgments as well as naturalness judgements for all 600 images.

### Conditions

The BFD has been developed by Mirella Walker and colleagues at the University of Basel, Switzerland. The BFD can be used freely for non-commercial scientific research.

The only problem is that they state that the images may not be modified ([point 4](https://bfd.unibas.ch/en/request/license-agreement/)).
