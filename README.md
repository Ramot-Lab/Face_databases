## CFD -- Chicago face database
https://chicagofaces.org/default/ 

There are two main databases:

1. **CFD**  
      The main CFD set consists of images of 597 unique individuals. They include self-identified Asian, Black, Latino, and White female and male models, recruited in the United States. All models are represented with neutral facial expressions. A subset of the models is also available with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressions. Norming data are available for all neutral expression images. Subjective rating norms are based on a U.S. rater sample.

2. **CFD-MR**  
      The CFD-MR extension set includes images of 88 unique individuals, who self-reported multiracial ancestry. All models were recruited in the United States. The images depict models with neutral facial expressions. Additional facial expression images with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressions are in production and will become available with a future update of the database. Norming data include the standard set of CFD objective and subjective image norms as well as the models’ self-reported ancestry. Subjective norms are based on a U.S. rater sample.

3. **CFD-INDIA**  
      The CFD-India extension set includes images of 142 unique individuals, recruited in Delhi, India. The images depict models with neutral facial expressions. Additional facial expression images with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressionsare in production and will become available with a future update of the database. Norming data include the standard set of CFD objective and subjective image norms and self-reported background information on the models (e.g., ancestry, home state, caste). Subjective norms are available for a U.S. rater sample and for a sample of raters recruited in India. In addition, an extended set of self-reported model background data (e.g., ancestry, home state, caste) is available upon request.

NOTE: The addition background data not requested yet.

## BFDB -- Basel face database 
https://bfd.unibas.ch/en/ 

The Basel Face Database (BFD) is built upon portrait photographs of forty different individuals. All these photographs have been manipulated to appear more or less agentic and communal (Big Two personality dimensions) as well as open to experience, conscientious, extraverted, agreeable, and neurotic (Big Five personality dimensions). Thus, the database consists of forty photographs of different individuals and 14 variations of each of them signaling different personalities. Using this database therefore allows to investigate the impact of personality on different outcome variables in a very systematic way.

The BFD consists of photographs of 18 male and 22 female undergraduate students from the University of Basel with an average age of 23 years. The individuals look directly towards the camera with a neutral, relaxed facial expression.

All 40 photographs have been systematically manipulated to show reduced or enhanced values on the Big Two (agency and communion) and on the Big Five (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and extraversion) personality dimensions. This results in a total of 15 images per individual, and 600 images in total.

The validation file contains means and standard deviations of the Big Two and Big Five personality judgments as well as naturalness judgements for all 600 images.

## FEI Face Database
https://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html

The FEI face database is a Brazilian face database that contains a set of face images taken between June 2005 and March 2006 at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of FEI in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil. There are 14 images for each of 200 individuals, a total of 2800 images. All images are colourful and taken against a white homogenous background in an upright frontal position with profile rotation of up to about 180 degrees. Scale might vary about 10% and the original size of each image is 640x480 pixels. All faces are mainly represented by students and staff at FEI, between 19 and 40 years old with distinct appearance, hairstyle, and adorns. The number of male and female subjects are exactly the same and equal to 100. Figure 1 shows some examples of image variations from the FEI face database.

## Wild Faces Database, WFD (not used, not downloaded)

Facial expressions are thought to be complex visual signals, critical for communication between social agents. Most prior work aimed at understanding how facial expressions are recognized has relied on stimulus databases featuring posed facial expressions, designed to represent putative emotional categories (such as ‘happy’ and ‘angry’). Here we use an alternative selection strategy to develop the Wild Faces Database (WFD); a set of one thousand images capturing a diverse range of ambient facial behaviors from outside of the laboratory. We characterized the perceived emotional content in these images using a standard categorization task in which participants were asked to classify the apparent facial expression in each image. In addition, participants were asked to indicate the intensity and genuineness of each expression. While modal scores indicate that the WFD captures a range of different emotional expressions, in comparing the WFD to images taken from other, more conventional databases, we found that participants responded more variably and less specifically to the wild-type faces, perhaps indicating that natural expressions are more multiplexed than a categorical model would predict. We argue that this variability can be employed to explore latent dimensions in our mental representation of facial expressions. Further, images in the WFD were rated as less intense and more genuine than images taken from other databases, suggesting a greater degree of authenticity among WFD images. The strong positive correlation between intensity and genuineness scores demonstrating that even the high arousal states captured in the WFD were perceived as authentic. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential utility of the WFD as a new resource for bridging the gap between the laboratory and real world in studies of expression recognition.

# Emotions

## FACES -- A database of facial expressions in younger, middle-aged, and older women and men
https://faces.mpdl.mpg.de/imeji/

FACES is a set of images of naturalistic faces of 171 young (n = 58), middle-aged (n = 56), and older (n = 57) women and men displaying each of six facial expressions: neutrality, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and happiness. The FACES database was developed between 2005 and 2007 by Natalie C. Ebner, Michaela Riediger, and Ulman Lindenberger at the Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.

The database comprises two sets of pictures per person and per facial expression (a vs. b set), resulting in a total of 2,052 images. A subset of 72 pictures is available *without having to register in order to apply for a personal account*. **Research-related publication and display of the publicly available FACES objects are permitted for the purpose of illustrating research methodology.** However, if you plan to use the corresponding objects for such purposes, please register for FACES and send the FACES Platform Release Agreement (with a short description of how you plan to use the publicly available objects) to the FACES Technical Agent.

For detailed information about the development and validation of the database see Ebner, N., Riediger, M., & Lindenberger, U. (2010). FACES—A database of facial expressions in young, middle-aged, and older women and men: Development and validation. Behavior research Methods, 42, 351-362. doi:10.3758/BRM.42.1.351. Please always refer to this publication whenever you use objects from the FACES platform.

After development of the face stimuli, in a subsequent validation study, a total of 154 young (n = 52), middle-aged (n = 51), and older (n = 51) women and men rated the faces in terms of facial expression, perceived age, attractiveness, and distinctiveness. These picture-specific normative ratings can be downloaded here :

    rating results for facial expression
    rating results for perceived age
    rating results for attractiveness
    rating results for distinctiveness

The first two dimensions (facial expression and perceived age) are described in Ebner, N., Riediger, M., & Lindenberger, U. (2010). FACES—A database of facial expressions in young, middle-aged, and older women and men: Development and validation. Behavior research Methods, 42, 351-362. doi:10.3758/BRM.42.1.351. More detailed descriptions for the latter two dimensions are available in Ebner, N. C., Luedicke, J., Voelkle, M. C., Riediger, M., Lin, T., & Lindenberger, U. (2018). An adult developmental approach to perceived facial attractiveness and distinctiveness. Frontiers in Psychology, 9:561. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00561.

#### Dynamic FACES

Dynamic FACES is an extension of the original FACES database. It is a database of morphed videos (n = 1,026) of young, middle-aged, and older adults displaying six naturalistic emotional facial expressions including neutrality, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and happiness. Static images used for morphing came from the original FACES database. Videos were created by transitioning from a static neutral image to a target emotion. Videos are available in 384 x 480 pixels as .mp4 files or in original size of 1280 x1600 as .mov files.

For further information about Dynamic FACES see:

#### Scrambled FACES

All 2,052 images from the original FACES database were scrambled using MATLAB. With the randblock function, original FACES files were treated as 800x1000x3 matrices – the third dimension denoting specific RGB values – and partitioned into non-overlapping 2x2x3 blocks. The matrices were then randomly shuffled by these smaller blocks, providing final images that matched the dimensions of the original image and were composed of the same individual pixels, although arranged differently. All scrambled images are 800x1000 jpeg files (96 dpi).

## NimStim

https://danlab.psychology.columbia.edu/content/nimstim-set-facial-expressions

Paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3474329/

This set is large in number, multiracial, and available to the scientific community online. The results of psychometric evaluations of these stimuli are presented. The results lend empirical support for the validity and reliability of this set of facial expressions as determined by accurate identification of expressions and high intra-participant agreement across two testing sessions, respectively.

[Info](https://osf.io/y86rw/wiki/home/): Dataset is comprising of 672 images of naturally posed photographs by 43 professional actors (18 female, 25 male) ranging from 21 to 30 years old. Actors from a diverse sample were chosen to portray emotional expressions within this dataset. To be precise, the actors were African-American (N = 10), Asian-American (N = 6), European-American (N = 25), Latino-American (N = 2). The images contained in this dataset include eight emotional expressions, namely: neutral, angry, disgust, surprise, sad, calm, happy, and afraid. Both open and closed mouth versions were provided for all emotional expressions, with the exception of surprise (only open mouth provided) and happy (high arousal open mouth/exuberant provided). The face stimuli can be accessed for free on: http://www.macbrain.org/resources.htm.

**Checked with them, not possible to use online at all!**

## Padova Emotional Dataset of Facial Expressions (PEDFE)
A unique dataset of genuine and posed emotional facial expressions

Paper: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3474329/](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-022-01914-4)

This dataset tries to fill this gap, providing a considerable amount (N = 1458) of dynamic genuine (N = 707) and posed (N = 751) clips of the six universal emotions from 56 participants. The dataset is available in two versions: original clips, including participants’ body and background, and modified clips, where only the face of participants is visible. Notably, the original dataset has been validated by 122 human raters, while the modified dataset has been validated by 280 human raters. Hit rates for emotion and genuineness, as well as the mean, standard deviation of genuineness, and intensity perception, are provided for each clip to allow future users to select the most appropriate clips needed to answer their scientific questions.

## Pictures of Facial Affect (POFA), The Ekman 60 Faces Test

https://www.paulekman.com/product/pictures-of-facial-affect-pofa/

Costs $399, has been the most widely used and validated series of photographs in facial expression research. The Ekman 60 Faces Test can be used to assess recognition of facial expressions of basic emotions. The maximum test score indicating best performance is 60 for all six emotions (happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise and anger) and 10 for each basic emotion.

The POFA collection consists of 110 photographs of facial expressions that have been widely used in cross-cultural studies, and more recently, in neuropsychological research. All images are black and white.  A brochure providing norms is included with the collection. It is important to  note that these images are not identical in intensity or facial configuration.

# Audiovisual databases

## The Sabancı University Dynamic Face Database (SUDFace)
The SUDFace database consists of 150 high-resolution audiovisual videos acquired in a controlled lab environment and stored with a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels at a frame rate of 60 Hz. The multimodal database consists of three videos of each human model in frontal view in three different conditions: vocalizing two scripted texts (conditions 1 and 2) and one Free Speech (condition 3). The main focus of the SUDFace database is to provide a large set of dynamic faces with neutral facial expressions and natural speech articulation. Variables such as face orientation, illumination, and accessories (piercings, earrings, facial hair, etc.) were kept constant across all stimuli. We provide detailed stimulus information, including facial features (pixel-wise calculations of face length, eye width, etc.) and speeches (e.g., duration of speech and repetitions). In two validation experiments, a total number of 227 participants rated each video on several psychological dimensions (e.g., neutralness and naturalness of expressions, valence, and the perceived mental states of the models) using Likert scales. The database is freely accessible for research purposes.

# Databases with artificially created faces

## One Million Impressions (OMI)
The diversity of human faces and the contexts in which they appear gives rise to an expansive stimulus space over which people infer psychological traits (e.g., trustworthiness or alertness) and other attributes (e.g., age or adiposity). Machine learning methods, in particular deep neural networks, provide expressive feature representations of face stimuli, but the correspondence between these representations and various human attribute inferences is difficult to determine because the former are high-dimensional vectors produced via black-box optimization algorithms. Here we combine deep generative image models with over 1 million judgments to model inferences of more than 30 attributes over a comprehensive latent face space. The predictive accuracy of our model approaches human interrater reliability, which simulations suggest would not have been possible with fewer faces, fewer judgments, or lower-dimensional feature representations. Our model can be used to predict and manipulate inferences with respect to arbitrary face photographs or to generate synthetic photorealistic face stimuli that evoke impressions tuned along the modeled attributes.

# Tools to create artificial faces

### Face Research Toolkit: A free and open-source toolkit of three-dimensional models and software to study face perception.
A problem in the study of face perception is that results can be confounded by poor stimulus control. Ideally, experiments should precisely manipulate facial features under study and tightly control irrelevant features. Software for 3D face modeling provides such control, but there is a lack of free and open source alternatives specifically created for face perception research. Here, we provide such tools by expanding the open-source software MakeHuman. We present a database of 27 identity models and six expression pose models (sadness, anger, happiness, disgust, fear, and surprise), together with software to manipulate the models in ways that are common in the face perception literature, allowing researchers to: (1) create a sequence of renders from interpolations between two or more 3D models (differing in identity, expression, and/or pose), resulting in a “morphing” sequence; (2) create renders by extrapolation in a direction of face space, obtaining 3D “anti-faces” and caricatures; (3) obtain videos of dynamic faces from rendered images; (4) obtain average face models; (5) standardize a set of models so that they differ only in selected facial shape features, and (6) communicate with experiment software (e.g., PsychoPy) to render faces dynamically online. These tools vastly improve both the speed at which face stimuli can be produced and the level of control that researchers have over face stimuli. We validate the face model database and software tools through a small study on human perceptual judgments of stimuli produced with the toolkit.
