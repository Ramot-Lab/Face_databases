# Used databases
## Carolinska 
The Averaged Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces dataset (Lundqvist, D., & Litton, J. E. (1998). The Averaged Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, the [homepage](https://kdef.se/home/aboutKDEF.html))

### Reference
Lundqvist, D., Flykt, A., & Öhman, A. (1998). The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces—KDEF (CD ROM). Stockholm: Karolinska Institute, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Psychology Section.

### Conditions
They state [here](https://www.kdef.se/home/using%20and%20publishing%20kdef%20and%20akdef.html) that you have to cite but can freely use (but their point C and B are weirdly contraicting themselves).

Stimuli can be published.

## Psychological Image Collection at Stirling (PICS), University of Stirling
This is a collection of images useful for conducting experiments in psychology, primarily faces, though other submissions are welcome. They are free for research use.

http://pics.psych.stir.ac.uk/2D_face_sets.htm 

There are several datasets:
* Aberdeen:  
      687 Colour faces from Ian Craw at Aberdeen. Between 1 and 18 images of 90 individuals.  Some variations in lighting, 8 have varied viewpoint. Resolution: varied: 336x480 to 624x544
      
* Iranian women:  
      369 images, 34 women, mostly with smile and neutral in each of five orientations. Resolution: 1200x900 colour

* Nottingam scans (not that good):  
      50 males and 50 females in neutral, frontal pose. Resolution: 358-463 to 468x536 monochrome

* Stirling faces (not that good):  
      312 images: 35 identities (18 female, 17 male), in 3 poses and 3 expressions. Resolution: 269x369 monochrome
* Pain expressions:  
      599 images; posed expressions, usually 2 of each of the six basic emotions plus 10 of pain, also 45 degree and profile neutral. 13 women, 10 men. Resolution: 720x576 colour
* Utrecht  
      131 images, 49 men, 20 women, usually a neutral and smile of each, collected at the European Conference on Visual Perception in Utrecht, 2008.  Some more to come, and 3d versions of these images in preparation. Resolution: 900x1200 colou
* Mooney  
      2 sets of 24 Mooney faces, coded as male/female or looking left/right.  BMP format, 575x580 pixels

The folder on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h8o2pr9hwj70jfq/AADCSZgEqro2INJR3JPpNhb4a?dl=0) contains the images, face ratings, luminescense matching and some other masks. But may not be accessible (I'm not the owner).

### Conditions
There is an agreement pdf file (and on a webpage they have a form), I obrained from one guy in the lab who had it (Arik Shkolnikov). They have 4 pictures (M071, M023, F074, M048) which can be published, they're in the pdf.

## CFD -- Chicago face database
https://chicagofaces.org/default/ 

There are two main databases:

1. CFD
The main CFD set consists of images of 597 unique individuals. They include self-identified Asian, Black, Latino, and White female and male models, recruited in the United States. All models are represented with neutral facial expressions. A subset of the models is also available with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressions. Norming data are available for all neutral expression images. Subjective rating norms are based on a U.S. rater sample.

2. CFD-MR
The CFD-MR extension set includes images of 88 unique individuals, who self-reported multiracial ancestry. All models were recruited in the United States. The images depict models with neutral facial expressions. Additional facial expression images with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressions are in production and will become available with a future update of the database. Norming data include the standard set of CFD objective and subjective image norms as well as the models’ self-reported ancestry. Subjective norms are based on a U.S. rater sample.

3. *CFD-INDIA (Forthcoming)*
The CFD-India extension set includes images of 142 unique individuals, recruited in Delhi, India. The images depict models with neutral facial expressions. Additional facial expression images with happy (open mouth), happy (closed mouth), angry, and fearful expressionsare in production and will become available with a future update of the database. Norming data include the standard set of CFD objective and subjective image norms and self-reported background information on the models (e.g., ancestry, home state, caste). Subjective norms are available for a U.S. rater sample and for a sample of raters recruited in India.

### Conditions
The CFD and its expansion sets are a free resource for the scientific community. The database photographs and their accompanying information may be used free of charge for non-commercial research purposes only. The database materials cannot be re-distributed or published without written consent from the copyright holder, the University of Chicago, Center for Decision Research.
